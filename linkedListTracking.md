Shruti's Solution:
My gist:

Build a LinkedList with the following methods:
- [x ] Append data
- [ x] Prepend data
- [x ] Print values of all nodes
- [ x] Remove the first node that contains a given value
- [ x] Count the number of nodes in the LinkedList.
- [ x] Search for a value in the LinkedList. Return true if the value is found, false otherwise.
- [ x] Delete a node with a specificvalue from the linked list.
- [ x] Remove the first*k*nodes from the linked list
- [ x] Reverse a linked list.
- [ x] Return the data in the*k*th node from the end, starting the count at 0.
- [ x] Return the value of the middle node in the linked list.
- [ x] Return true, if the linked list has a cycle. Return false if the linked list terminated with nil and does not have a cycle.
*provide time and space complexities for algorithms

Test Cases:
* the linked list is empty (do not cause null dereference exception)
* the linked list has one node
* the linked list has an odd number of nodes
* the linked list has an even number of nodes

Notes:
- Leverage OOD
- Build both singly and doubly linked lists
